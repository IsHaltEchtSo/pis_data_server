### Effective Note Taking
- HMW assist in note-taking from resources? (Books, Articles, ...)
- HMW capture enough data to reconstruct a resource (skrim once, then deconstruct and reconstruct?)
- HMW make an effective note-taking paper tool  
(that can shrink/extend depending on âˆ‘notes & easy navigate/fold and unfold & easy to take with you)

### Linking Note-Clusters & The Zettel-Network
- HMW connect store note-clusters & stored insights from the ZK? (hunch: somehow integrate them into the biosphere)
- HMW tag the Note-Clusters? (project tags per notes-cluster? or per note in the notes-cluster?)

### Working On A Project
- HMW display/visualize all the data for a given project?
- HMW help to collect, display & organise the correct parts into a framework & how to store it?

### Digitalizing Note-Cluster & ZK-Inbox
- HMW help to make the note-processing easier? 
- HMW establish a red thread?

### Systematic Naming Conventions
- HMW store data for easy retrival later on? (think meta-tag problem)
- HMW display the different projects that are existing? (for tags)
- HMW help to store the resource with some kind of systematic naming convention?

### Open General Questions
- Shouldn't be stuff like a volleyball log stored as well somehow? Or only the condensed insights that derive from it?
